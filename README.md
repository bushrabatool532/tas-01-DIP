# DIP-Task-1
Task 01
Using Python, OpenCV, and Matplotlib, write a program to read a colored image from a given file path. Check whether the image is loaded successfully. Convert the image from BGR to RGB format for correct display. Split the image into its Red, Green, and Blue color components. Convert the image into grayscale and then generate a binary image using thresholding. Finally, display the original image, individual color components, grayscale image, and binary image using Matplotlib subplots.
